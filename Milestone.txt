Creating presentation Because this is a two-week project, you’ll want to make sure that you have a set portion of the site finished by the end of the first week to stay on track. Though you will divide the work among your group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the application. Don’t silo yourself, hoping that everything will work together. Instead, check in regularly and offer support. Make sure you are in sync and help each other when a blocker arises.
